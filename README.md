## Side note
All requirements should be fulfilled & some more.

Quoted comments load in a bit wonky. There's a few fixes that I can think of for that but none that seemed ideal for the way I ended up handling the observables.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Learning a framework from scratch with only a month's worth of experience in React 3 years ago is tough, especially without guidance.
